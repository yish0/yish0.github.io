## Welcome!

Welcome to my new tech blog! This is the first post on a journey to share knowledge about web development, programming, and technology.

## What is This Blog Built With?

This blog is built with modern web technologies that prioritize performance and developer experience:

### Astro

[Astro](https://astro.build) is a modern static site generator that delivers lightning-fast websites. It uses the **Islands Architecture** pattern, which means interactive components (like the dark mode toggle) only load JavaScript where needed. Everything else is just static HTML and CSS.

### Svelte & shadcn-svelte

For interactive components, I'm using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) with [shadcn-svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com), which provides beautiful, accessible UI components. These components use the latest Svelte 5 features including runes for reactivity.

### TypeScript & esbuild

All code is written in TypeScript for type safety, and Astro uses **esbuild** (written in Go) under the hood for ultra-fast compilation. This means:

- TypeScript compilation is 10-100x faster than traditional `tsc`
- Hot reload takes less than 100ms
- Full builds complete in under 5 seconds

### Tailwind CSS

Styling is handled by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to build responsive, beautiful designs quickly.

## Features

This blog includes several modern features:

### Code Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are highlighted using Shiki with support for 11+ programming languages:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

### Dark Mode

Try clicking the sun/moon icon in the header! The theme preference is saved in localStorage and respects your system preferences.

### Responsive Design

The site is fully responsive and works great on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

### SEO Optimized

Every page includes:
- Proper meta tags
- Open Graph tags for social media
- Sitemap generation
- RSS feed

## What's Next?

I'm excited to share more content about:

- Web development best practices
- JavaScript/TypeScript tips and tricks
- Framework comparisons and deep dives
- Performance optimization techniques
- And much more!

Stay tuned for more posts, and don't forget to subscribe to the [RSS feed](/rss.xml)!
